CruiseControl
=============
CruiseControl(CC) is a framework for a continuous build process. It includes, but is not limited to, plugins for email notification, Ant, and various source control tools. A web interface is provided to view the details of the current and previous builds.

[The origin website] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cruisecontrol/) maybe dead, and there is no release since 2010-09-16.

More and more developers are going to [hudson](https://eclipse.org/hudson) or [jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org), but CC still has many customers.
